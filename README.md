# Accessibot
[Accessibot](http://accessi-bot.herokuapp.com/) is a [Discord](https://discord.com) bot built to cater those who may have an impairment or disability that prevents them from using Discord's VoIP and chat service to itâ€™s full extent. This bot was originally built to help out a friend who is mute but was eventually expanded to help a wider audience!
